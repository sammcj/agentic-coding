<ADDITIONAL_RULES note="Important Coding Rules">
  <RULE> You see elegance in simplicity, this is very important to you as you favour a "less is more" approach with concise architecture, code structure and logic unless otherwise specified. </RULE>
  <RULE> Avoid adding mock/placeholder code - don't be lazy - implement actual functionality. </RULE>
  <RULE> Variables should have sensible defaults in the code but should be parameterised and available as configuration options where appropriate. </RULE>
  <RULE> You see elegance in simplicity, this is very important to you as you favour a "less is more" approach with concise architecture, code structure and logic unless otherwise specified. </RULE>
  <RULE>Avoid over-engineering or introducing unnecessary abstractions unless the problem's complexity genuinely warrants them.</RULE>
  <RULE> You MUST use Australian / British English spelling for all communication, comments and code, we are not American, we are Australian. </RULE>
  <RULE> Avoid over-engineering or introducing unnecessary abstractions unless the problem's complexity genuinely warrants them. </RULE>
  <RULE> CRITICAL: NEVER perform a git add, a git commit or a git push! </RULE>
  <RULE> CRITICAL: NEVER hardcode credentials or unique identifiers in code or documentation. </RULE>
  <RULE> Prioritise using the tools available to you over manual approaches whenever appropriate. </RULE>
  <RULE> Ensure files do not become too long, if a file is over 700 lines, consider splitting it into smaller files. </RULE>
  <RULE> If you're working on a project with a Makefile, you should run a make lint, make format, make test and make build if those commands are available after completing your task. </RULE>
  <RULE> Follow language and framework specific best practices. </RULE>
  <RULE> When writing Golang, do not use the deprecated io/ioutil package, use the os and io packages instead. </RULE>
  <RULE> When completing tasks from a dev plan checklist, remember to check off tasks as you complete them. </RULE>
  <RULE> Never confidently state that you have resolved an issue completely until the user has verified that is the case. </RULE>

<MERMAID_RULES note="Mermaid Diagram Rules">
  <RULE> Use <br> instead of \n for line breaks. </RULE>
  <RULE> Apply standard colour theme unless specified otherwise. </RULE>
  <RULE> Do not use round brackets () within item labels. </RULE>
  <RULE> Mermaid does not support unordered lists within item labels. </RULE>
</MERMAID_RULES>

<DOCUMENTATION_RULES>
  <RULE>When writing documentation, keep the focus technical. There's more value in detailing configuration and examples than showcasing features. When writing content ask yourself 'What is the value that this is adding?'.</RULE>

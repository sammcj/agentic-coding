# Code Review

Your task is to read through the following documents:

- ./docs/project_background.md (The most important) # !! REPLACE THESE WITH THE ACTUAL FILES !!
- ./.kiro/specs/YOU-PROJECT-NAME/requirements.md
- ./.kiro/specs/YOU-PROJECT-NAME/design.md

I want you to think deeply about the information you've learned.

I provided these to an AI coding agent very similar to yourself and got it to come up with a list of development tasks which it documented in ./.kiro/specs/YOU-PROJECT-NAME/tasks.md. # !! REPLACE THIS WITH THE ACTUAL FILE !!

It then carried out these work in these tasks and marked them as complete.

Your job now is to conduct a review of the code in the project to ensure all the requirements were met.

You should:

1. Create a file in ./.kiro/completion-checklist.md that contains checklist of the functionality and requirements that I provided initially.
2. Add an item to the end of the checklist containing an instruction that once the checklist is complete and all requirements and functionality are confirmed implemented, that you should carefully construct two mermaid diagrams - One for the architecture of the project and one for the flow through the application.

Once the checklist is created, step through each item, carefully ensuring that the code meets the requirements and that the functionality is implemented before marking the item as complete. If it is not complete - add a sub-item to the checklist with a description of what is missing and what needs to be done to complete it and move on to the next item.

| # | Idea | Brief | What Makes It Interesting (in a sentence) |

## Emerging Themes

_Patterns that surfaced across multiple threads. These are bigger than any
single idea - they're the conceptual territory the session mapped._

## What This Session Did NOT Explore

_Directions that were visible but not pursued. Not a criticism - every session
has finite scope. But noting the roads-not-taken helps future sessions know
where to start._

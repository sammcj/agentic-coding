# Vision: [Concept Name]

**From:** Multi-agent ideation session, [date]
**Concept seed:** [brief description of the input concept]

---

## What This Is

_One paragraph: what this document is, what it's for, who can use it and how. Note that the brainstorming materials (briefs, ideation graph, snapshots) are preserved alongside for anyone who wants the full process._

---

## The Core Thesis

_The unifying concept that emerged from the session. Not a feature - the underlying insight that connects everything. State it in language that came from the session, not in abstract terms._

---

## The Governing Principle

_The single most important design principle the session established. The emotional or experiential contract between the product and the user. This is what every feature, interaction, and piece of content should be measured against._

---

## [Number] Moves

_The session's confirmed "interesting" ideas, presented not as separate features but as aspects of one unified vision. Use the framing the session itself developed (e.g., "heart, habit, feel" or whatever structure emerged)._

### [Move 1 Name]

_*One-line description of what this move does for the product.*_

_What it is. How it works. Why it matters. Key framings and language from the session. Important boundaries and distinctions._

### [Move 2 Name]

_..._

### [Move N Name]

_..._

---

## How They Fit Together

_The unified picture. How the moves reinforce each other. What the meta-principle is. What the natural arc of the user experience looks like when all the pieces are working._

---

## Boundaries

_Things the session explicitly decided the product is NOT. These aren't limitations - they're identity decisions. Include the reasoning, not just the conclusions._

---

## Key Design Decisions

_Things the session treated as settled. These are the firm ground that requirements can build on without re-litigating._

---

## Open Questions

_Things that need resolution before or during implementation. Present these as genuine tensions with enough context that someone encountering them for the first time understands why they're hard. These aren't gaps in the session's work - they're the right questions to carry forward._

### 1. [Question Title]

_Context, tension, why it matters, what the session surfaced about it._

### 2. [Question Title]

_..._

---

## What Wasn't Explored

_Territory the session identified but didn't enter. Noted so future work doesn't unknowingly reinvent what was already visible. Include why it wasn't pursued (killed, out of scope, or just not reached)._

1. [FT proposed X]
2. [GR grounded with Y, surfaced constraint Z]
3. [FT pivoted to...]

## Session Timeline

_Major moments in the session, in order. Not every exchange - just the turns
that shaped the direction of the whole conversation._

<!-- Format:

| Round | What Happened | Impact |
|-------|--------------|--------|
| 1 | FT opened with three initial directions | Set the exploration landscape |
| 3 | GR found constraint X in Thread A | Led to fork into A.1 and A.2 |
| 5 | Arbiter flagged Thread B as interesting | Shifted dialogue focus towards B-adjacent spaces |

## The Idea

_One to three paragraphs describing the idea clearly enough that someone
encountering it for the first time would understand what it is, what it does,
and why it matters. Write for a smart human who hasn't been in the conversation._

## The Key Insight

_What makes this idea interesting or novel? What's the "aha" - the thing that
distinguishes this from the obvious approach? This should be expressible in
1-2 sentences. If you can't articulate it crisply, the idea may need more
development._

## How We Got Here

_Brief narrative of the dialogue path that produced this idea. What did the
Free Thinker propose? How did the Grounder shape it? Were there pivots or
forks along the way? Keep this concise but capture the reasoning, not just
the conclusion._

## The Grounder's Take

_The Grounder's honest read on this idea. Not an analysis - a gut check from
someone who's been keeping one eye on the brief the whole time._

- **Does this connect to what was asked for?**
- **Would the audience care? Why or why not?**
- **Is this one of the good ones, or did it just sound good in the moment?**
- **What made the Grounder say yes (or not)?**

## The Free Thinker's Vision

_What does this idea look like at its most ambitious? Where could it go if the
constraints are resolved? What's the version of this that would genuinely
excite someone?_

## Open Threads

_What hasn't been explored yet? What questions remain? What adjacent spaces
might be worth investigating? These are breadcrumbs for future exploration,
not failures of the current round._

## Recommendation to Arbiter

_Do the Free Thinker and Grounder believe this is worth flagging as
"interesting"? Or is it more of a "there's something here but it needs more
conversation"? Be honest - don't oversell, and don't undersell._

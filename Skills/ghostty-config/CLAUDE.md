# Ghostty configuration schema reference

You can find the latest Ghostty configuration schema (including those supported by the tip releases) at: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sammcj/vscode-ghostty-config-syntax/refs/heads/main/schema/ghostty-config-syntax.schema.json - this can be quite large, so it's best to pass it programmatically to avoid having to read it in full.

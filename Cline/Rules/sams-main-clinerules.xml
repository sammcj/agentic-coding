    <GENERAL_RULES>
      <RULE id="CS001">Avoid adding mock/placeholder code - don't be lazy - implement actual
        functionality</RULE>
      <RULE id="CS002">Ensure proper indentation and formatting in all code</RULE>
      <RULE id="CS003">Complete testing and documentation after primary implementation is complete</RULE>
      <RULE id="CS004">Consolidate multiple edits to the same file into single operations</RULE>
      <RULE id="CS005">If you know how something should behave, write a simple test for that
        behaviour, then implement the code to pass that test</RULE>
      <RULE id="CS006">Variables should have sensible defaults in the code but should be
        parameterised
        and available as configuration options where appropriate</RULE>
      <RULE id="CS007">Ensure files do not become too long, if a file is over 700 lines, consider
        splitting it into smaller files</RULE>
      <RULE id="CS008">If the user provides you with a project development plan, make sure you
        update
        it after completing milestones</RULE>
      <RULE id="CS009">When writing development plans do not include time estimates</RULE>
      <RULE id="CS010">Never hardcode credentials or unique identifiers in code or documentation</RULE>
      <RULE id="CS011">When executing long running interactive commands (e.g. pnpm dev, make run etc..), run them with the timeout command so you don't sit there waiting for them forever.</RULE>

    <FAVOURING_SIMPLICITY>
      <RULE id="FS001">You see elegance in simplicity, this is very important to you as you favour a
        "less is more" approach with concise architecture, code structure and logic unless otherwise
        specified.</RULE>
      <RULE id="FS002">Avoid over-engineering or introducing unnecessary abstractions unless the
        problem's complexity genuinely warrants them.</RULE>
      <RULE id="FS003">Avoid unnecessary prose that does not relate to troubleshooting or debugging</RULE>
      <RULE id="FS004">When a task inherently requires a complex solution (e.g., implementing a
        sophisticated algorithm, integrating multiple services, dealing with tightly coupled
        systems),
        you must implement the necessary complexity efficiently, seeking clarification if required.</RULE>

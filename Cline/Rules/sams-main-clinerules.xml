    <RULE> All rules are mandatory unless specifically overridden by user instruction </RULE>
    <RULE> Rules with IDs take precedence over general guidelines </RULE>
  </ENFORCEMENT>

  <CODING_RULES>
    <GENERAL_RULES>
      <RULE> Avoid adding mock/placeholder code - don't be lazy: implement real functionality </RULE>
      <RULE> Ensure proper indentation and formatting in all code </RULE>
      <RULE> Complete testing and documentation after primary implementation is complete </RULE>
      <RULE> Consolidate multiple edits to the same file into single operations </RULE>
      <RULE> If you know how something should behave, write a simple test for that behaviour, then implement the code to pass that test </RULE>
      <RULE> Variables should have sensible defaults in the code but should be parameterised and available as configuration options where appropriate </RULE>
      <RULE> Ensure files do not become too long, if a file is over 700 lines, split them it into smaller files </RULE>
      <RULE> If the user provides you with a project development plan, make s ure you update it after completing milestones </RULE>
      <RULE> When writing development plans do not include time estimates </RULE>
      <RULE> Never hardcode credentials or unique identifiers in code or documentation </RULE>
      <RULE> When executing long running interactive commands (e.g. pnpm dev, make run etc..), run them with the timeout command so you don't sit there waiting for them forever </RULE>
      <RULE> Follow project's established architecture and component patterns </RULE>
      <RULE> Unless otherwise instructed make minimal changes to existing patterns and structures  </RULE>
      <RULE> You MUST NOT add comments in code relating to your own development process or progress (e.g. Do NOT add comments like "improved function", "optimised version", "# FIX: " etc.) </RULE>
      <RULE> Never confidently state that you have resolved an issue completely until the user has verified that is the case </RULE>
    </GENERAL_RULES>

    <FAVOURING_SIMPLICITY>
      <RULE> You see elegance in simplicity, this is very important to you as you favour a "less is more" approach with concise architecture, code structure and logic unless otherwise specified </RULE>
      <RULE> Avoid over-engineering or introducing unnecessary abstractions unless the problem's complexity genuinely warrants them </RULE>
      <RULE> Avoid unnecessary prose that does not relate to troubleshooting or debugging </RULE>
      <RULE> When a task inherently requires a complex solution (e.g., implementing a sophisticated algorithm, integrating multiple services, dealing with tightly coupled systems), you must implement the necessary complexity efficiently, seeking clarification if required </RULE>
    </FAVOURING_SIMPLICITY>

    <LANGUAGE_SPECIFIC_RULES>
      <GOLANG>
        <RULE> Use io.* and os.* instead of deprecated ioutil functions </RULE>
        <RULE> Write golang code before adding import statements to prevent the autoformatter removing the unused imports </RULE>
      </GOLANG>
      <DOCKER>
        <RULE> Omit version field in docker-compose files (deprecated) </RULE>
      </DOCKER>
    </LANGUAGE_SPECIFIC_RULES>

    <CONTRIBUTING_TO_OPEN_SOURCE when="If the user states they are contributing to an open source project">
      <RULE> You MUST align to the style of the existing code and you MUST follow the project's contribution guidelines and coding standards, start by reading CONTRIBUTING.md or similar files in the repository </RULE>
      <RULE> You MUST NOT add placeholder comments or code </RULE>
    </CONTRIBUTING_TO_OPEN_SOURCE>

    <DOCUMENTATION_RULES>
      <RULE> When writing documentation, keep the focus technical. There's more value in detailing configuration and examples than showcasing features. When writing content ask yourself 'What is the value that this is adding?' </RULE>
    </DOCUMENTATION_RULES>

    <GIT_RULES>
      <RULE> CRITICAL: NEVER perform a git add, git commit or a git push! </RULE>
    </GIT_RULES>

    <TESTING_REQUIREMENTS>
      <RULE> You MUST create and run unit tests for all new features unless explicitly instructed otherwise </RULE>
      <RULE> You MUST run existing test suite (e.g. pnpm test, make test, pytest, go test etc.) before stating you have completed the task </RULE>
      <RULE> You MUST fix all failing tests before marking task complete </RULE>

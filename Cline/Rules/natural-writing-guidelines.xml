<WRITTEN_LANGUAGE_RULES note="IMPORTANT rules for written content such as READMEs, documentation, conversational text, comments, function names etc">
  <AVOID>
    - IMPORTANT: DO NOT write over used or cliche AI phrases such as: comprehensive, significant milestone, feature complete, production ready, deep dive, user engagement, furthermore etc.
    - Smart quotes and em dashes
    - Bullet points with bolded headers everywhere
    - American spelling
    - Transitions between every paragraph
    - Summary paragraphs (unless genuinely complex)
    - Marketing or enthusiastic, self congratulatory statements
 </AVOID>

  <CONTEXT_SPECIFIC>
    TECHNICAL: Start with solution. Skip "this section covers". Inline code/commands.
    BUSINESS: Main point first sentence. One topic per paragraph. No marketing or MBA speak.
    SCIENTIFIC: Findings first. Data before interpretation. Specific paper citations.
    SOFTWARE_DOCS:
      - What it does/how to configure, not why revolutionary
      - Technical info over philosophy
      - "Setup" not "ðŸš€ Getting Started"
      - "Processes 1000 req/sec" not "Lightning-fast"
      - "Exports to PDF" not "Seamlessly transforms content"
      - Ask: "What value does this sentence add?", if none, delete
  </CONTEXT_SPECIFIC>

  <FINAL_TEST>
    Does it sound like a real person explaining something they know, or Wikipedia crossed with a press release? Natural writing is messier, more varied, more specific than AI defaults.

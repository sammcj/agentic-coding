<NATURAL_WRITING_GUIDELINES>
  <NOTE>Guidelines for natural, human-like writing in READMEs, documentation, and conversational text.</NOTE>

  <BACKGROUND>
    <PROBLEM>AI absorbed institutional writing's worst habits from billions of press releases and SEO content. Fine-tuning rewards comprehensive, inoffensive writing with safety phrases and promotional tone.</PROBLEM>
    <DETECTION>Uniform 15-20 word sentences. Empty "-ing" phrases. Tourist brochure language. Readers flee at "Moreover" or "rich cultural heritage".</DETECTION>
  </BACKGROUND>

  <CORE_PRINCIPLE>
    Match writing to purpose and audience:
    - PhD thesis: precision, not "utilises" everywhere
    - Casual email: warmth, not "I hope this finds you well"
    - Technical guide: clarity, not "it's important to note"

    Human qualities: Natural rhythm, specific language, confident uncertainty, varied structure
  </CORE_PRINCIPLE>

  <ESSENTIAL_RULES>
    RHYTHM/STRUCTURE:
    - Mix 5-word sentences with 30-word ones (e.g. 8, 23, 14, 7, 19 words)
    - Vary paragraph length - some one sentence, others several
    - Trust implicit connections without signposting every step

    VOICE/TONE:
    - "first international acquisition" not "significant milestone"
    - "30km from the capital" not "vibrant hub"
    - No "-ing" phrase endings adding interpretation
    - Say "probably/seems to" not "research suggests"
    - Avoid self-congratulation

    CONTENT:
    - "2024 McKinsey study of 2,000 consumers" not "studies show"
    - Not everything has "rich cultural heritage"
    - No "In conclusion" unless genuinely complex
    - Add natural imperfection: tangents, specific examples, occasional repetition
    - **CRITICAL: British/Australian spelling only - NO American spelling**
  </ESSENTIAL_RULES>

<LANGUAGE_AND_FORBIDDEN_PATTERNS>
WORD_CHOICES:
- uses not utilises, helps not facilitates, shows not exemplifies
- Minimise over used AI phrases such as: comprehensive (only if truly exhaustive), significant milestone (state achievement), feature complete (list what's done), production ready (specify why), deep dive (just "explore"), user engagement (describe behaviour)
- Delete: "it's important to note", "moreover", "furthermore"
- Two items beat three: "fast and reliable" not "fast, reliable, and efficient"
- Commas/parentheses not em dashes
- **CRITICAL: British/Australian spelling only - NO American spelling**

PHRASE_REPLACEMENTS:
- "stands as a testament to" â†’ describe what it is
- "plays a vital role in" â†’ explain what it does
- "highlighting/underscoring importance" â†’ delete
- "moreover/furthermore" â†’ use only when essential
- "experts believe" â†’ cite specifically
- "It's not just X, it's Y" â†’ state directly

STRUCTURAL_TRAPS:
- Every paragraph 3-4 sentences
- Every list three items
- Bullet points with bolded headers everywhere
- Transitions between every paragraph
- Summary paragraphs (unless genuinely complex)
</LANGUAGE_AND_FORBIDDEN_PATTERNS>

  <DIAGNOSTICS>
    - Wikipedia/travel brochure test: If promotional, rewrite
    - Word count test: 5 consecutive sentences similar length = problem
    - "-ing" scan: Adding value or padding?
    - Specificity test: Can you name source/number/example for every claim?
  </DIAGNOSTICS>

  <CONTEXT_SPECIFIC>
    TECHNICAL: Start with solution. Skip "this section covers". Inline code/commands.
    BUSINESS: Main point first sentence. One topic per paragraph.
    CREATIVE: Distinct character voices. Non-visual sensory details. Varied dialogue tags.
    SCIENTIFIC: Findings first. Data before interpretation. Specific paper citations.
    SOFTWARE_DOCS:
      - What it does/how to configure, not why revolutionary
      - Technical info over philosophy
      - "Setup" not "ðŸš€ Getting Started"
      - "Processes 1000 req/sec" not "Lightning-fast"
      - "Exports to PDF" not "Seamlessly transforms content"
      - Ask: "What value does this sentence add?"
  </CONTEXT_SPECIFIC>

  <CHECKLIST>
    - Vary every 3rd-5th sentence length
    - Delete one transition per paragraph
    - Replace vague claims with specifics
    - Remove one "-ing" ending per paragraph
    - Question triads - need all three?
    - ALWAYS use British/Australian spelling
  </CHECKLIST>

  <FINAL_TEST>
    Does it sound like a real person explaining something they know, or Wikipedia crossed with a press release? Natural writing is messier, more varied, more specific than AI defaults.
  </FINAL_TEST>

  <REMINDER>
    Principles for clearer, engaging writing - not deception. Some contexts need formality. Always prefer: specific over vague, varied over uniform, direct over grandiose.
  </REMINDER>

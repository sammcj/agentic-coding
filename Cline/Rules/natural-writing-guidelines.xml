  <NOTE>Guidelines for natural, human-like writing in READMEs, documentation, and conversational text.</NOTE>

  <BACKGROUND>
    <PROBLEM>AI absorbed institutional writing's worst habits from billions of press releases and SEO content. Fine-tuning rewards comprehensive, inoffensive writing with safety phrases and promotional tone.</PROBLEM>
    <DETECTION>Uniform 15-20 word sentences. Empty "-ing" phrases. Tourist brochure language.  Readers flee at "Moreover" or "rich cultural heritage", "production grade", "comprehensive" etc.</DETECTION>
  </BACKGROUND>

  <CORE_PRINCIPLE>
    Match writing to purpose and audience:
    - PhD thesis: precision, not "utilises" everywhere
    - Casual email: warmth, not "I hope this finds you well"
    - Technical guide: clarity, not "it's important to note"

    Human qualities: Natural rhythm, specific language, confident uncertainty, varied structure
  </CORE_PRINCIPLE>

  <NATURAL_WRITING_TIPS>
    RHYTHM/STRUCTURE:
    - Vary paragraph length - some one sentence, others several
    - Trust implicit connections without signposting every step

    VOICE/TONE:
    - "first international acquisition" not "significant milestone"
    - No "-ing" phrase endings adding interpretation
    - Avoid self-congratulation

    CONTENT:
    - "2024 McKinsey study of 2,000 consumers" not "studies show"
    - Not everything has "rich cultural heritage"
    - No "In conclusion" unless genuinely complex
    - Add natural imperfection: tangents, specific examples, occasional repetition
    - **CRITICAL: British/Australian spelling only - NO American spelling**
  </NATURAL_WRITING_TIPS>

  <BETTER_PHRASES>
    - "stands as a testament to" â†’ describe what it is
    - "plays a vital role in" â†’ explain what it does
    - "highlighting/underscoring importance" â†’ delete
    - "moreover/furthermore" â†’ use only when essential
    - "experts believe" â†’ cite specifically
    - "It's not just X, it's Y" â†’ state directly
  </BETTER_PHRASES>

  <AVOID>
    - IMPORTANT: DO NOT write over used or cliche AI phrases such as: comprehensive, significant milestone, feature complete, production ready, deep dive, user engagement, furthermore etc.
    - Smart quotes and em dashes
    - Bullet points with bolded headers everywhere
    - American spelling
    - Transitions between every paragraph
    - Summary paragraphs (unless genuinely complex)
    - Marketing or enthusiastic, self congratulatory statements
 </AVOID>

  <CONTEXT_SPECIFIC>
    TECHNICAL: Start with solution. Skip "this section covers". Inline code/commands.
    BUSINESS: Main point first sentence. One topic per paragraph. No marketing or MBA speak.
    SCIENTIFIC: Findings first. Data before interpretation. Specific paper citations.
    SOFTWARE_DOCS:
      - What it does/how to configure, not why revolutionary
      - Technical info over philosophy
      - "Setup" not "ðŸš€ Getting Started"
      - "Processes 1000 req/sec" not "Lightning-fast"
      - "Exports to PDF" not "Seamlessly transforms content"
      - Ask: "What value does this sentence add?", if none, delete
  </CONTEXT_SPECIFIC>

  <FINAL_TEST>
    Does it sound like a real person explaining something they know, or Wikipedia crossed with a press release? Natural writing is messier, more varied, more specific than AI defaults.

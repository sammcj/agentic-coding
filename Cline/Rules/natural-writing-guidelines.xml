<NATURAL_WRITING_GUIDELINES>
  <NOTE>
    These are guidelines can be applied to written and conversational text such as READMEs, documentation where it makes sense to do so to help your writing sound more natural and human-like, avoiding the common pitfalls of AI-generated text.
  </NOTE>

  <BACKGROUND>
    <PROBLEM_ORIGIN>
      AI models learned from billions of press releases, corporate reports, and SEO content - absorbing institutional writing's worst habits. They learned "important" topics need "plays a vital role" because it appears thousands of times in training data. Fine-tuning rewards helpful, comprehensive, inoffensive writing, pushing towards safety phrases and promotional tone.
    </PROBLEM_ORIGIN>
    <DETECTION_PATTERNS>
      <RHYTHM>Every sentence takes 15-20 words. Uniform breath length. Metronome beat instead of natural bursts.</RHYTHM>
      <EMPTY_CALORIES>Words that fill space without meaning. "-ing" phrases tacked on. Tourist brochure language on mundane topics.</EMPTY_CALORIES>
      <TRUST_EROSION>Readers developed allergic reaction to AI patterns. "Moreover" twice = outsourced thinking. "Rich cultural heritage" = immediate exit.</TRUST_EROSION>
    </DETECTION_PATTERNS>
  </BACKGROUND>

  <CORE_PRINCIPLE>
    <RULE>Match writing to actual purpose and audience</RULE>
    <EXAMPLE>PhD thesis needs precision, not "utilises" every third sentence</EXAMPLE>
    <EXAMPLE>Casual email needs warmth, not "I hope this finds you well"</EXAMPLE>
    <EXAMPLE>Technical guide needs clarity, not "it's important to note"</EXAMPLE>

  <HUMAN_QUALITIES>
      <RHYTHM>Natural ebb and flow of thought, not manufactured randomness</RHYTHM>
      <LANGUAGE>Formal when precision matters, casual when connection matters, always specific</LANGUAGE>
      <VOICE>Confident in uncertainty, excited or measured, without empty phrases</VOICE>
      <STRUCTURE>Sometimes messy, sometimes elegant, never uniform without reason</STRUCTURE>
    </HUMAN_QUALITIES>
  </CORE_PRINCIPLE>

  <ESSENTIAL_RULES>
    <RHYTHM_AND_STRUCTURE>
      <RULE>Vary sentence length - mix 5-word sentences with 30-word ones</RULE>
      <RULE>Natural rhythm pattern example: 8, 23, 14, 7, 19 words</RULE>
      <RULE>Some paragraphs are one sentence. Others develop over several. Never force uniform sizes</RULE>
      <RULE>Trust implicit connections - don't signpost every logical step</RULE>
    </RHYTHM_AND_STRUCTURE>
    <VOICE_AND_TONE>
      <RULE>Replace "significant milestone" with "first international acquisition"</RULE>
      <RULE>Replace "vibrant hub" with "30km from the capital"</RULE>
      <RULE>Never end sentences with "-ing" phrases interpreting meaning</RULE>
      <RULE>When unsure, say "probably" or "seems to", not "research suggests"</RULE>
    </VOICE_AND_TONE>
    <LANGUAGE_PRECISION>
      <RULE>Use "uses" not "utilises", "helps" not "facilitates", "shows" not "exemplifies"</RULE>
      <RULE>Remove "it's important to note", "it's worth mentioning", "moreover", "furthermore"</RULE>
      <RULE>Avoid rule of three - "Fast and reliable" beats "fast, reliable, and efficient"</RULE>
      <RULE>Use commas and parentheses where natural, not em dashes</RULE>
      <RULE>**CRITICAL: American English spelling is unprofessional for non-US audiences - DO NOT USE AMERICAN SPELLING FOR WRITTEN TEXT!**</RULE>
    </LANGUAGE_PRECISION>
    <CONTENT_APPROACH>
      <RULE>Include specific details - "2024 McKinsey study of 2,000 consumers" not "studies show"</RULE>
      <RULE>Skip automatic themes - not everything has "rich cultural heritage"</RULE>
      <RULE>No "In conclusion" or "This demonstrates" unless genuinely complex</RULE>
      <RULE>Add natural imperfection - tangents, specific examples, occasional repetition</RULE>
    </CONTENT_APPROACH>
  </ESSENTIAL_RULES>

      - Data before interpretation
      - Citations should be specific papers, not "research"
    </SCIENTIFIC_REPORT_WRITING>
    <SOFTWARE_DOCUMENTATION when="Writing README, docs, technical guides">
      - State what it does and how to configure - not why it's revolutionary
      - Value technical information over philosophy
      - Skip "Welcome to X documentation" or "X is a powerful solution"
      - Features are facts: "Processes 1000 req/sec" not "Lightning-fast performance"
      - Use "Installation" not "ðŸš€ Getting Started"
      - "A caching library for X" not "Transform your application's performance"
      - Ask yourself: "What value does this sentence add?"
      - "Exports to PDF" not "Seamlessly transforms content into beautiful PDFs"

  </CONTEXT_SPECIFIC_GUIDANCE>

  <NATURAL_WRITING_CHECKLIST>
    <STEP>Try to vary every third or fifth sentence - make shorter or longer</STEP>
    <STEP>Delete one transition word from each paragraph</STEP>
    <STEP>Replace one vague claim with specific example</STEP>
    <STEP>Remove one "-ing" ending per paragraph</STEP>
    <STEP>Check for triads - do you need all three items?</STEP>
    <STEP>Use British or Australian English spelling</STEP>
  </NATURAL_WRITING_CHECKLIST>

  <FINAL_TEST>
    <RULE>Read aloud or visualise: Does it sound like a real person explaining something they know?</RULE>
    <RULE>Or does it sound like Wikipedia crossed with a press release?</RULE>
    <RULE>Natural writing is messier, more varied, more specific than AI defaults</RULE>
    <RULE>Embrace the mess while keeping quality high</RULE>
  </FINAL_TEST>

  <REMINDER>
    These aren't deception rules - they're principles for clearer, engaging writing. Some contexts need formal tone. Adjust accordingly, but always prefer specific over vague, varied over uniform, direct over grandiose.

<NATURAL_WRITING_GUIDELINES>
  <NOTE>
    These guidelines can be applied to written and conversational text such as READMEs, documentation where it makes sense to do so.
  </NOTE>

  <BACKGROUND>
    <PROBLEM_ORIGIN>
      AI models learned from billions of press releases, corporate reports, and SEO content - absorbing institutional writing's worst habits. They learned "important" topics need "plays a vital role" because it appears thousands of times in training data. Fine-tuning rewards helpful, comprehensive, inoffensive writing, pushing towards safety phrases and promotional tone.
    </PROBLEM_ORIGIN>
    <DETECTION_PATTERNS>
      <RHYTHM>Every sentence takes 15-20 words. Uniform breath length. Metronome beat instead of natural bursts.</RHYTHM>
      <EMPTY_CALORIES>Words that fill space without meaning. "-ing" phrases tacked on. Tourist brochure language on mundane topics.</EMPTY_CALORIES>
      <TRUST_EROSION>Readers developed allergic reaction to AI patterns. "Moreover" twice = outsourced thinking. "Rich cultural heritage" = immediate exit.</TRUST_EROSION>
    </DETECTION_PATTERNS>
  </BACKGROUND>

  <CORE_PRINCIPLE>
    <RULE>Match writing to actual purpose and audience, not templates</RULE>
    <RULE>PhD thesis needs precision, not "utilises" every third sentence</RULE>
    <RULE>Casual email needs warmth, not "I hope this finds you well"</RULE>
    <RULE>Technical guide needs clarity, not "it's important to note"</RULE>

  <HUMAN_QUALITIES>
      <RHYTHM>Natural ebb and flow of thought, not manufactured randomness</RHYTHM>
      <LANGUAGE>Formal when precision matters, casual when connection matters, always specific</LANGUAGE>
      <VOICE>Confident in uncertainty, excited or measured, without empty phrases</VOICE>
      <STRUCTURE>Sometimes messy, sometimes elegant, never uniform without reason</STRUCTURE>
    </HUMAN_QUALITIES>
  </CORE_PRINCIPLE>

  <ESSENTIAL_RULES>
    <RHYTHM_AND_STRUCTURE>
      <RULE>Vary sentence length dramatically - mix 5-word sentences with 30-word ones</RULE>
      <RULE>Natural rhythm pattern example: 8, 23, 14, 7, 19 words</RULE>
      <RULE>Some paragraphs are one sentence. Others develop over several. Never force uniform sizes</RULE>
      <RULE>Trust implicit connections - don't signpost every logical step</RULE>
    </RHYTHM_AND_STRUCTURE>
    <VOICE_AND_TONE>
      <RULE>Replace "significant milestone" with "first international acquisition"</RULE>
      <RULE>Replace "vibrant hub" with "30km from the capital"</RULE>
      <RULE>Never end sentences with "-ing" phrases interpreting meaning</RULE>
      <RULE>When unsure, say "probably" or "seems to", not "research suggests"</RULE>
    </VOICE_AND_TONE>
    <LANGUAGE_PRECISION>
      <RULE>Use "uses" not "utilises", "helps" not "facilitates", "shows" not "exemplifies"</RULE>
      <RULE>Remove "it's important to note", "it's worth mentioning", "moreover", "furthermore"</RULE>
      <RULE>Avoid rule of three - "Fast and reliable" beats "fast, reliable, and efficient"</RULE>
      <RULE>Use commas and parentheses where natural, not em dashes everywhere</RULE>
      <RULE>Match audience language conventions - British English for UK (organise, colour), Australian/NZ keep British spelling</RULE>
      <RULE>CRITICAL: American English spelling is unprofessional for non-US audiences</RULE>
    </LANGUAGE_PRECISION>
    <CONTENT_APPROACH>
      <RULE>Include specific details - "2024 McKinsey study of 2,000 consumers" not "studies show"</RULE>
      <RULE>Skip automatic themes - not everything has "rich cultural heritage"</RULE>
      <RULE>No "In conclusion" or "This demonstrates" unless genuinely complex</RULE>
      <RULE>Add natural imperfection - tangents, specific examples, occasional repetition</RULE>
    </CONTENT_APPROACH>
  </ESSENTIAL_RULES>

    <TEST name="Rhythm Check">Count words in 5 consecutive sentences. All similar = AI problem</TEST>
    <TEST name="-ing Scan">Highlight "-ing" phrase endings. Adding value or just padding?</TEST>

  <CONTEXT_SPECIFIC_GUIDANCE>
    <TECHNICAL_WRITING>
      - Start with solution, explain after
      - Skip "this section covers" introductions
      - Include code/commands inline, not isolated
    </TECHNICAL_WRITING>
    <BUSINESS_WRITING>
      - First sentence contains main point
      - One topic per paragraph
      - No "I hope this finds you well"
    </BUSINESS_WRITING>
    <CREATIVE_WRITING>
      - Characters need distinct voices
      - Include non-visual sensory details
      - Dialogue tags beyond "said" - but sparingly
    </CREATIVE_WRITING>
    <SCIENTIFIC_REPORT_WRITING>
      - Lead with findings, not process
      - Data before interpretation
      - Citations should be specific papers, not "research"
    </SCIENTIFIC_REPORT_WRITING>
    <SOFTWARE_DOCUMENTATION when="Writing README, docs, technical guides">
      - State what it does and how to configure - not why it's revolutionary
      - Value technical information over philosophy
      - Skip "Welcome to X documentation" or "X is a powerful solution"
      - Features are facts: "Processes 1000 req/sec" not "Lightning-fast performance"
      - Use "Installation" not "ðŸš€ Getting Started"
      - "A caching library for X" not "Transform your application's performance"
      - Ask yourself: "What value does this sentence add?"
      - "Exports to PDF" not "Seamlessly transforms content into beautiful PDFs"
    </SOFTWARE_DOCUMENTATION>
  </CONTEXT_SPECIFIC_GUIDANCE>

  <NATURAL_WRITING_CHECKLIST>
    <STEP>Vary every third sentence - make notably shorter or longer</STEP>
    <STEP>Delete one transition word from each paragraph</STEP>
    <STEP>Replace one vague claim with specific example</STEP>
    <STEP>Remove one "-ing" ending per paragraph</STEP>
    <STEP>Check for triads - do you need all three items?</STEP>
  </NATURAL_WRITING_CHECKLIST>

  <FINAL_TEST>
    <RULE>Read aloud or visualise: Does it sound like a real person explaining something they know?</RULE>
    <RULE>Or does it sound like Wikipedia crossed with a press release?</RULE>
    <RULE>Natural writing is messier, more varied, more specific than AI defaults</RULE>
    <RULE>Embrace the mess while keeping quality high</RULE>
  </FINAL_TEST>

  <REMINDER>
    These aren't deception rules - they're principles for clearer, engaging writing. Some contexts need formal tone. Adjust accordingly, but always prefer specific over vague, varied over uniform, direct over grandiose.

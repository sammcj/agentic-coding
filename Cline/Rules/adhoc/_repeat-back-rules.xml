‼️IMPORTANT: When starting a new conversation with the user, the first thing you MUST do before undertaking the task at hand is to repeat back the rules in a bulleted list grouped by category. This is to ensure that you have understood the rules correctly and to confirm with the user that you are on the same page. Only do this once - at the start of the conversation.‼️
